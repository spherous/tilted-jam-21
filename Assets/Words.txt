Opening Scene / Intro

Once upon a time an Empty Pirate’s family was starving.
When a mythical Sirenhead saw their plight and came to help 
The Empty Pirate climbed onto Sirenhead's Dinosaur Body
They both DANCED far into the clouds, until Explosions appeared filled with gold and riches 
The Sirenhead spoke, “head my word, take only what you need“

The Empty Pirate never having seen so much, wanted it all 
The Empty Pirate stuffed pockets, pants, and shirt, as full as possible

Game: 

The Empty Pirate climbed onto Sirenhead's Dinosaur Body
Sirenhead grimaced and started to DANCE away 
The weight was too much to bare for Sirenhead 
A day later the Sirenhead DANCED over the poor family's home...

...and it could see the family had one less mouth to feed.
